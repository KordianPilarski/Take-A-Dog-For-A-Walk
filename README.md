# Take-A-Dog-For-A-Walk
An React app where you can arrange to walk a dog.

In app you can filter dogs list by name, description and weight. You can choose date and lenght of the walk and add it to Your Walks cart.

I used axios for fetching data from external API, hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer), React-DateTime-Picker and CSS Modules for styling.
